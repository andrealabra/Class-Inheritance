# Class-Inheritance

The single colon : could also signify class inheritance, if the class declaration is followed by : and a class name, it means the class derives from the class behind the single colon.

Example for Class and Inheritance 


/*
 * Inheritance and classes are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming
 * (OOP) that help organize and structure code in a more manageable and reusable way.
 *
 * Classes: Classes are like blueprints or templates for creating objects (instances).
 * They define the properties (data) and behaviors (functions/methods) that objects of that class will have.
 * In simpler terms,a class is like a recipe for creating objects with specific characteristics and actions.
 *
 * Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows you to create a new class based on an existing class.
 * The new class inherits the properties and behaviors of the existing class, and you can also add new properties
 * or behaviors or override existing ones in the new class.
 * Inheritance is like building upon an existing blueprint or extending it.
 *
 * Classes provide a way to define the structure of objects, and inheritance allows you to reuse and extend
 * that structure to create new classes with shared characteristics and specialized features.
